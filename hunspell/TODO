- Hunspell tested only with utf8 encoded dictionaries. No idea what will be
  happening if I use dictionary having other encoding like ISO-8859-2.

- Native binding actually uses the C API of hunspell library which provides a
  very basic set of functions. Basically it is enough for my original purposes
  but likely to change to the much richer C++ API.
